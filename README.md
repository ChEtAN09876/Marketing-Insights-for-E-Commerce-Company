The objectives are to optimize marketing campaigns across various channels, leverage data insights to enhance customer retention, predict customer lifetime value, and ultimately drive sustainable revenue growth.

Marketing Campaign Impact: Explore the relationship between marketing spend (online & offline) and customer behavior (orders, revenue) to assess campaign effectiveness. Utilize techniques like hypothesis testing to validate your findings.
Discount Analysis: Investigate how discounts and promotions affect revenue and customer engagement. Analyze KPIs like average order value and customer acquisition cost across different discount structures.

# Deeper Analysis:
Seasonality & Trends: Identify seasonal trends and patterns in sales data across different timeframes (month, week, day) to inform future marketing strategies.
Calculate key performance indicators (KPIs) like revenue, number of orders, and average order value across various dimensions (category, month, week, day).
Marketing Spend & Revenue: Calculate revenue, marketing spend, and delivery charges by month to understand their correlation. This can reveal areas for optimization.
Product & Customer Relationships: Analyze co-purchased products through market basket analysis. This will uncover cross-selling opportunities and inform product placement strategies.
Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV): Implement predictive models to estimate the future value of each customer. This helps prioritize retention efforts for high-value customers.

# Cohort Analysis:
Create customer cohorts based on their acquisition month. Track their behavior (orders, revenue) over time to identify the cohort with the highest retention rate. This reveals valuable customer acquisition trends.
